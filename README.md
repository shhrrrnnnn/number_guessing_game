# Number Guessing Game 🎯

A beginner-friendly number guessing game made with Python.

The computer picks a number between 1 and 50, and the player keeps guessing until they get it right. After each round, the player can choose to play again.

## 💡 Features
- Random number generation
- Hints if your guess is too high or too low
- Option to replay after each round
- Clean and friendly user interaction

## 🛠️ How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed.

Run the game with:
```bash
python number_guessing_game.py
---
What i learned 
- Python basic like loops, conditionals and user input
- Using random module
- Adding replay funtion

I plan to work on this project and add more features as I strengthen my python skills.
